      Shortly before his 16th birthday, Musk applied for passports with his

    <h3>Entrepreneurial Activities</h3>
    <hr />
    <h4>Zip2 (1995</h4>
    <p>
      --> Main article : <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip2">Zip2</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1995, Musk co-founded his first company, Zip2 , with his brother
      Kimbal, providing content for media companies. According to Musk, at the
      time he had "a vague idea of ​​the opportunity that a dot -com company,
      $2,000 in capital, a car and a computer could offer." When computer maker
      Compaq bought the company for $307 million in 1999, was this the highest
      price paid for an Internet company up to that point; Musk himself was then
      able to access $22 million in capital through his stake.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>X.com and PayPal (1999/2000)</h4>
    <p>
      --> Main articles :
      <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.com">X.com</a> and
      <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal">PayPal</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately afterwards, in 1999, Musk founded the company X.com , which
      developed an online payment system via e-mail . In 2000, X.com merged with
      competitor Confinity , which specialized in a similar product called
      PayPal . [33] In the years that followed, PayPal became the most important
      online payment system in the world - and achieved sales proceeds of 1.5
      billion US dollars when it was sold to eBay in 2002 . Musk held 11.7% of
      the company's shares at the time, making it the largest shareholder. [34]
      In July 2017, Musk reacquired the x.com domain from PayPal.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Musk's Internet company opened up new markets with products that did
      not previously exist in this form, the business idea that was to underlie
      the entrepreneurial activities of the following years was different: Musk
      wanted expensive and technically complex products that were cheaper and
      suitable for mass production offer.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>SpaceX (2002)</h4>
    <p>
      --> Main article :
      <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX">SpaceX</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Musk's third founding was the space company SpaceX in 2002 . He is CEO and
      chief rocket designer there. Within 15 years, SpaceX has become the
      world's leading commercial provider of orbital rocket launches, especially
      for the transport of satellites into orbit, thanks to high
      cost-efficiency. In addition, SpaceX has been supplying the ISS space
      station with the Dragon spaceship since 2012 . With the successor Crew
      Dragon , the first manned flight to the ISS took place in May 2020. [37]
      Russia accused Musk of deliberately trying to force Russian space
      transporters out of the market with discount prices.
    </p>
    <p>
      SpaceX's goal is to reduce the cost of space transportation to the point
      where it will be possible to settle people on other celestial bodies -
      especially Mars. [40] A first groundbreaking step on this path was the
      establishment of a landable and reusable rocket stage in 2017. The second
      major step towards affordable space travel is to take place with the fully
      reusable Starship rocket , which is under development . Long-term, flights
      for Martian settlers are targeted for under $500,000 per person.
